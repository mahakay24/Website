    <p>
      Roblox (/ˈroʊblɒks/ ⓘ, ROH-bloks) is an online game platform and game
      creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to
      program and play games created by themselves or other users. Created by
      David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform
      hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming
      language Lua. Early in Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as
      a platform and as a company. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second
      half of the 2010s, and this growth was accelerated by the COVID-19
      pandemic.[11][12] Roblox is free to play, with in-game purchases available
      through a virtual currency called Robux. As of August 2020, Roblox had
      over 164 million monthly active users, including more than half of all
      American children under 16.[13][14] Although Roblox has received generally
      positive reviews from critics, it has faced criticism for its content
      moderation, microtransactions, and allegations of exploitative practices
      toward children.
