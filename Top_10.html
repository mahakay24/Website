    <h1>Top 10 Festivals</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Rio Carnival – Brazil</li>
      <p>
        <a

          target="_blank"
        >
          The Rio Carnival</a
        >
        is a euphoric cacophony of beautiful people, costumes, samba, and more
        feathers than you can count. Like an epic citywide flash mob accompanied
        by floats, the Rio Carnival can never be imitated and has to be
        experienced firsthand. And unlike most parades, everyone is welcome to
        dance and join in on the procession.
      </p>
      <li>La Tomatina – Spain</li>
      <p>
        Besides fulfilling that pre-adolescent need of being part of a massive
        food fight? I could tell you it’s because
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Tomatina" target="_blank"
          >La Tomatina</a
        >
        is a time-honored tradition, or that the citizens of Buñol revere it,
        but Iuld be lying. La Tomatina is just pure unadulterated PG fun!
      </p>
      <li>Carnival of Venice – Italy</li>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_of_Venice"
          target="_blank"
        >
          The Carnival of Venice</a
        >
        (Italian: Carnevale di Venezia; Venetian: Carneval de Venèsia) is an
        annual festival held in Venice, Italy, famous throughout the world for
        its elaborate costumes and masks. The Carnival ends on Shrove Tuesday
        (Martedì Grasso or Mardi Gras), which is the day before the start of
        Lent on Ash Wednesday.
      </p>
      <li>Huong Pagoda Festival - Vietnam</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagoda_festival" target="_blank"
          >Huong Pagoda Festival
        </a>
        The festival is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to peek behind the
        curtains and experience firsthand the spiritual life of the Vietnamese
        people. With amazing local delicacies, shows, and activities, amidst the
        backdrop of apricot flowers and Buddhist temples, you might end up never
        leaving
      </p>
      <li>Pingxi Lantern Festival – Taiwan</li>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Lantern_Festival"
          target="_blank"
          >Pingxi Lantern Festival</a
        >
        With an astounding 100,000 + lanterns floating into the sky, you’re
        really not going to see this anywhere else. The Pingxi Sky Lantern
        Festival is a visual bonanza. A surreal experience of hopes and
        aspirations manifested.
      </p>
      <li>Oktoberfest – Munich, Germany</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest" target="_blank">
          Oktoberfest festival</a
        >
        An important tradition of Bavarian culture since 1810, the Oktoberfest
        has transformed over the centuries into the world’s largest fair.
        Boasting over 80+ rides, 14 extravagant beer tents, and more food than
        you can eat in a lifetime, the festival warrants the estimated six and a
        half million visitors that come every year. The festivities are between
        16 to 18 days depending on if the first Sunday of October falls on the
        1st or 2nd.
      </p>
      <li>Songkran Water Festival – Thailand</li>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songkran_(Thailand)"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Songkran Water Festival</a
        >
        Although there are certainly benefits to being able to launch a water
        balloon at unsuspecting strangers, the Songkran water festival is also
        an opportunity to observe Thai tradition. Water brings new begi…who am I
        kidding…it’s about the water fight!
      </p>
      <li>Holi- India</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holi" target="_blank">
          Holi- India</a
        >
        Social conventions be damned! How often will you have the opportunity to
        party side by side with elephants, or dance with wild abandonment while
        participating in a turban tying competition? And if that’s not enough,
        ambush someone with a fistful of color powder!
      </p>
      <li>Mardi Gras – United States</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardi_Gras" target="_blank">Mardi Gras</a>
        Ever get that feeling where you wish the party never ends? In New
        Orleans, it never really does. After spending the day dancing and
        parading with your favorite Krewes, you can don your mask and beads and
        then mosey on over to Bourbon street to continue your evening libations.
        And if you still have energy the next day, get up and do it all over
        again!
      </p>
      <li>Glastonbury Music Festival – England</li>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival"
          target="_blank"
          >Glastonbury Music Festival</a
        >
        Unless you hate music, comedy, theatre or entertainment in general, this
        is certainly a worthy addition to your bucket list. Think of it as 5
        days liberated from the shackles of the “real world” where you get to
        camp out with like-minded, free spirited individuals. Social labels need
        not apply here, as the Glastonbury festival is a social hodgepodge of
        nationalities, creeds, ages, and lifestyles. Truly an experience you’ll
        never forget.
