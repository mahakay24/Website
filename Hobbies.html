      <p>
        Piano is rewarding from day 1 because you don’t have to “make” the sound
        yourself. All you have to do is press a key that’s attached to a hammer
        that hits a string to create a perfectly clear note. Most people can
        figure out a simple melody on a keyboard by playing around. Of course,
        there’s more to playing piano than eking out “Twinkle, Twinkle Little
        Star,” but at least you won’t be squeaking through your first few
        lessons!

      <li>Writing</li>

      <p>
        Writing is the act of creating a persistent representation of human
        language. A writing system uses a set of symbols and rules to encode
        aspects of spoken language, such as its lexicon and syntax. However,
        written language may take on characteristics distinct from those of any
        spoken language.

        A video game,[a] also known as a computer game or just a game, is an
        electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input
        device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing
        device) to generate visual feedback from a display device, most commonly
        shown in a video format on a television set, computer monitor,
        flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a virtual
        reality headset. Most modern video games are audiovisual, with audio
        complement delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also
        with other types of sensory feedback

        There are 180 currencies recognized as legal tender in United Nations
        (UN) member states, UN General Assembly non-member observer states,
        partially recognized or unrecognized states, and their dependencies.[1]
        However, excluding the pegged (fixed exchange rate) currencies, there
        are only 130 currencies that are independent or pegged to a currency
        basket. Dependencies and unrecognized states are listed here only if
        another currency is used on their territory that is different from the
        one of the state that administers them or has jurisdiction over them.

      <li>Building lego</li>
      <img src="images/Building_lego.jpg" alt="lego" />
      <p>
        Lego is a line of plastic construction toys manufactured by the Lego
        Group, a privately held company based in Billund, Denmark. Lego consists
        of variously coloured interlocking plastic bricks made of acrylonitrile
        butadiene styrene (ABS) that accompany an array of gears, figurines
        called minifigures, and various other parts. Its pieces can be assembled
        and connected in many ways to construct objects, including vehicles,
        buildings, and working robots. Assembled Lego models can be taken apart,
        and their pieces can be reused to create new constructions.

      <p>
        Drawing is a visual art that uses an instrument to mark paper or another
        two-dimensional surface. The instruments used to make a drawing are
        pencils, crayons, pens with inks, brushes with paints, or combinations
        of these, and in more modern times, computer styluses with graphics
        tablets or gamepads in VR drawing software.
