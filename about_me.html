    <p>
      I am Mahalakshmi Karthick studying P4. I am in Junyuan Primary School. My
      favourite subject is English. This is because it is a common and easy
      language. My favourite hobby is piano. My reason for my choice is because
      I love music. I also love laerning about Singapores past. I leaernt about
      Singapore falling into the Japanese's hands. I've also learnt about how
      Singapore became a indpendent nation. My first wish is to become a
      Cardiologist and a pianist. I love going to school. It is because, I like
      studying and talking with my friends. I am also in the school bullet
      point. Google accepts my name.

      Also, I love to read Young Scientist magzine (The Abduction Of Black
      Phanthom ). It is a nice magazine that gives us information about an
      object or a living thing. It also has unbelievable and fascinating
      experiments like how to make snow from a diaper. My favourite comics of
      the magazine is IT Savvy, Y.S. Detective Agency and the fun zone. The IT
      Savvy talks about inventions which are going to happen in the future.
      Something like a smart bird feeder called Bird Buddy
    </p>
    <p>
      The Y.S. Detective Agency talks about a man named Detective Carl solving a
      case of a jealous colleague. With his assistant Mark, he managed to solve
      the case of the jealous and murderous colleague. The fun zone is full of
      laughter and comedy. Like you brushed teeth, went to eat breakfast and
      your egg tasted minty because of your toothpaste. Y.S book also has lots
      of vocab. Such words like imminent , craters, vying, excruciating and
      knocking. At the back of the book, has information about a spinning ice
      circle. An ice circle, also known as an ice disc or an ice pan is an
      unusual natural phenomenon that occurs in slow moving water in cold
      climatic regions
