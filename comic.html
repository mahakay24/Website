      <div class="Candy">
        <h2>Mia</h2>
        <img src="images/Mia.jpg" alt="Mia" />
        <p>
          Mia is one of the main protagonists of the Candy Series and a member
          of Candy JEM. She is Joni's best friend since kindergarten. Together,
          they befriended Emilia while training for a singing competition. She
          designed Candy Meow, the mascot of Candy JEM as a symbol of the
          friendship between herself, Joni and Emilia.
        </p>

      <div class="Candy">
        <h2>Emilia</h2>
        <img src="images/Emilia.jpg" alt="Emilia" />
        <p>
          Emilia is one of the main protagonists of the Candy Series and a
          member of Candy JEM. She is regarded as one of Sacred Hearts Primary
          School's "princesses". She used to be very vain who looked down on the
          less wealthy along with Sofia, Zara and Qistina before becoming close
          friends with Joni and Mia. She is currently the class monitor of Class
          6A after Norman stepped down from the position due to him becoming the
          head prefect of the school.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Candy">
        <h2>Joni</h2>
        <img src="images/Joni.jpg" alt="Joni" />
        <p>
          Joni is shown to be a young, petite girl with fair skin and the
          shortest among Mia and Emilia and, like most of her friends, has a
          slender body figure. The most prominent features of Joni is the
          freckles on her face and her coral pink hair that she kept short. Just
          like almost all the other characters, she consistently change her
          clothing, but the most notable detail of her clothes is a golden star
          locket that was given by Mikael in Reaching for the Stars. Joni is
          always seen wearing boyish clothes as she has a strong dislike for
          skirts and dresses, may because it is hard for her to do any sporty
          things.

        <h2>Alexsandra</h2>
        <img src="images/Alex.jpg" alt="Alex" />
        <p>
          Alex is a petite 11-year-old girl with bobbed saddle brown hair and
          saddle brown eyes. Just like almost all the other characters, Alex
          does not consistently wear the same outfit but most of her outfits are
          considered plain or simple as she comes from a poor family background.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Candy">
        <h2>Sofia</h2>
        <img src="images/Sofia.jpg" alt="Sofia" />
        <p>
          Sofia bears a striking resemblance to her mother. She has cerise eyes
          and has shoulder-length straight magenta hair (curled in Season 2)
          with fringes that covers her forehead and part of her eyebrows. She is
          tall and has a slender figure. Sofia was also known to have hairy
          legs, as said by Joni when she was compared with Mia in Little Ladies:
          Courtesy.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Candy">
        <h2>Ayako</h2>
        <img src="images/Ayako.jpg" alt="Ayako" />
        <p>
          Ayako is a young girl around average height with long dark green hair
          with bangs that covers her eyebrows and black eyes which are framed by
          a pair of rectangular glasses. She wears a pink jacket over a white
          shirt and a black skirt. Ayako is a horror stories addict. She likes
          to scare away her friends by telling them horror stories. But she does
          have a cool personality, and likes to find out truth behind rumors and
          gossip.
